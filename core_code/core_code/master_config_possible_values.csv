,"unit cost over time for electricity technologies, excluding T&D. Moderate/conservative/advanced from NREL ATB. Pro-ff and pro-re combinations of conservative and advanced. (e.g. variable cost for solar electricity is 4 USD / mwh in 2039)",Standard deviation for cost vector scramble (e.g. 30% of wind turbine cost is 'steel products'),Cost profiles can be erratic. We smooth them over a sliding window of 5 years,Cost in USD / MW-mile of transmission line,Replace transmission cables by 3x more powerful ones for 1.37x the cost,3x more powerful lines take 1.37x the workforce to operate,"Number of workers per occupation-industry pair, data from BLS. In low we take the standard estimates - 1 sigma. For high we take the standard estimates + 1 sigma. (e.g. there are 300 accountants working for the mining industry)",IO table of production recipes (e.g. 10% of total output of the chemical sector was spent on oil&gas extraction),Uses below seeds to get min and max values for the following parameters,,,stylized scenario for changes to import and export fractions,stylized scenario for extreme changes to sense-check model

1) Total job demand-diff from reference.ipynb
- calculates the difference in results between the fast scenario and the no-new-policies baseline.
2) Total job demand-figures-diff from reference.ipynb
- makes figures
3) alternative_archetypes.ipynb
- alternative archetype definition (used in suppl information)
4) Building_archetypes.py

5) make_edgelist.ipynb
- makes the edgelist that merges career changers and occ mob network.
6) plot_archetypes.py
- does the archetype plot

- computes the averages of shocks between neighbors in/out respectively, etc.
8) plot_node_individual_assortativity.py, 
- does the corresponding plots.
9) files_for_gephi.py 
- makes .gexf file that then can easily be read by gephi.
10) Skill intensity, assortativity - rel to reference.ipynb
- calculates skill intensity of archetypes, and assortativity
